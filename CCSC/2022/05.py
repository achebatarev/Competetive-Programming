# making meadian a root of the tree repeating the process for subrtrees seems to work for BST, but it seems that TST might need some changes to make it work
# do not have a proof that this will work, so should use the idea of balancing a BST for TST
# Does right and left rotations change the tree invariant? Seems to work, just need to implement this idea
